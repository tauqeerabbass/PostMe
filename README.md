Backend Mini Project.
This is a Node.js and Express-based backend application designed for user management and content creation. It allows users to register and authenticate using secure methods like bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for token-based authentication. The app supports user profile creation, enabling users to make and manage posts on their profile. Additionally, weâ€™ve implemented protected routes to ensure secure access to sensitive data. The app provides a seamless and secure experience for users to interact with personalized content while maintaining privacy and security.
